		<h3> Who we are?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>My name is Elias Gautier and my wife Naylu. Fgxpress distributors in Puerto Rico and I’m here to show you something that
				 is in great demand plus very soon everybody will know about it so is best to jump in now that there is 
				 time to grab a good seat. Also if you are here reading this it means that you are looking for a solution
				  to your financial situation, which I believe we all want to fix it, right? <strong>Pay close attention to what 
				  I’m about to tell you. I’m pretty sure that solution for your situation is right here!!</strong> Most of us have
				   the same situation where is either hard to find a good job, or we have one and despite of how hard we 
				   work, money is not enough to sustain ourselves and our loved ones. I know in my case I get paid, pay 
				   all my bills and have to wonder how will I get through the next two weeks with only some change in my pocket. 
				   Sometimes is a miracle to put some food in my table and despite that I got to feel grateful because 
				   I know they are others worse than me. So yes we all have the same problem and like me you are here 
				   because you want a solution to that. I will open myself to you through this letter so you know that 
				   I can relate to you and that what I’m doing and offering to you is more than a solution to your situation, 
				   instead I’m offering love. Let me tell you real quick about this!! You are going to love it!</p>
				   
				<p>Like I said in the beginning I’m a distributor for FGXpress. A Company in over 150 countries worldwide who 
				is making an entrance whit their product in our local market. I’m talking about this revolutionary concept that
				 will spread love to everyone around you. Let me ask you. Are you in any kind of physical pain? If not, I’m pretty 
				 sure you know somebody that is right? Sooner or later we all feel some kind of pain. Well I have here with me this 
				 <strong>POWER STRIPS.</strong> They are Korean medicine and what they do is that works with the infrared heat that
				  comes out of our bodies and reflect this infrared heat back to you which increases the temperature in the area and allow 
				  the blood vessels to dilate which gives you a better flow of blood and the inflammation comes down giving you pain relief. 
				 Amazing right!! Best of all this power strips is that is completely natural composed of <strong>Germanium, Red Korean Ginseng, 
				 Silver and Marine Phytoplankton</strong> which is one the most complete sources of the essential nutrients our body needs.</p> 
				 
				 <p>We are proprietary of this ingredient in particular, which tells you that nobody will have this POWER STRIPS but us. They 
				 are amazing. Gave one to my wife and it work right away with some neck pain. Now grab hold to something. The POWER STRIPS last 
				 from 24 to 48 hours and It got approved as a class 1 FDA and an OTC Drug which is great for you so you can expand your market 
				 and offer something that is reliable, that works, and will bring comfort to the people around you. Best of all the company just 
				 launched a special website targeted to doctors so when you work with your presentation you can offer them better discounts for 
				 them to become distributors and take advantage of this product using them and giving them to their own patients. I’m pretty sure
				  you are thinking the same thing I thought when I first got hold of this info. But I won’t keep you reading more. Just take a look 
				  at these videos down here. Click on them, study them and contact me so we can start working on fixing that financial situation we 
				  all need by giving love to others.</p>
				  

				<p>All my contact info is down here. YOU AND ONLY YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF WHAT YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE. ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?</p>
